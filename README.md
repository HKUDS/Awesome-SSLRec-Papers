A collection of papers and resources about self-supervised learning (**SSL**) for recommendation (**Rec**).

Recommender systems personalize suggestions to combat information overload. Deep learning methods like RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers have improved these systems by understanding user behavior better. However, supervised learning struggles with data sparsity. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by using inherent data structures for supervision, reducing dependence on labeled data. SSL-based recommender systems accurately predict and recommend, even with sparse data, by leveraging unlabeled data for meaningful representations.
